    <p>Namaste friends and family! I started my trip with a trek to Everest Base Camp with an ex-colleague/friend. Rama and I used to sit next to each other at work and talked about all the stuff we wanted to do in our lives between the shitty never ending conference calls. We both dreamed of quitting our desk jobs and traveling the world. Fast forward 5 years, Rama finally did it and I followed suite 10 months later. After I decided to quit my job, I called Rama to see if he wanted to do the trek with me. He was traveling around India on a motorbike at the time and had aspirations of doing it before heading back to the US in the fall. Monsoon season starts in June, so we had to do it before the end of the season. We booked the last trip of the season with <a href="http://www.acethehimalaya.com">Ace the Himalaya</a> and showed up without much training. Side note, I'd recommend looking on <a href="http://www.theclymb.com">The Clymb</a> for deals if you want a guided trek. They are much cheaper than what is advertised on Ace the Himalaya site. I believe guides are mandatory, however it's much cheaper to show up in Lukla and find one, then to hire a company.</p>

    <p>Flying into Lukla is quite the adventure. Tenzing-Hillary Airport is rated the world's most dangerous airport for good reason. Lukla sits at 9,250ft and the runway is the size of a football field or 2 with an 11% gradient. The runway is literally on the side of a cliff with a wall at the end. As the plane is approaching the runway, it looks like it’s going to fly straight into the mountain side. As soon as the plane hits the runway, the pilot slams on the brakes, stopping just before the brick wall where tourists are lined up taking pictures and videos of the planes landing. There is no room for error landing on this runway. Most of us were scared shitless the whole plane ride in anticipation for the landing at the worlds most dangerous airport. All was well and we cheered after arriving safely.</p>

    <p>After landing at Lukla, we met our porters who would carry our duffel bags all the way to Gorak Shep. We started our 3 hour hike to Phakding (8,562ft), mostly downhill to the Dudh Koshi River and ‘nepali flat’, meaning short climbs and decent. We saw our first prayer wheels in a village along the way and started the ritual of spinning them each time we passed. Prayer wheels contain scrolls printed with prayers that are amplified with each turn of the wheel by hand. They are used to accumulate wisdom and karma to purify negatives and are spun clockwise (the same of the sun across the sky). There were tons of prayer stones and walls as well. They are carved with a single mantra (chant) or a prayer to the god of compassion. They are passed to the left side (clockwise) in the same direction the earth revolves.</p>
